'''
This function gets a data frame of all the NPOs rated the same in the general question. 
it iterates all the NPOs in this data frame and checks of each pair has the same dimensions (e.g
the differences in all dimensions ratings are not above 1) or has different dimensions (e.g. at least
one dimention has a difference above 2) 

The function returns 2 lists of tuples.
The first list contains tuples of same dimensions NPOs
The second list contains tuples of different dimensions NPOs
